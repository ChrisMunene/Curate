# Curate

Curate is an app that generates unique playlists for you based on your current mood.
Songs are generated via crowdsourcing from similar playlists made by other users on Spotify. 
The algorithm gathers user-generated playlists matching the key words and their songs, ranks them by relevance and adds the top songs to your queue, ready for listening.

The app was built as a final project for the android development class at AIT Budapest.
